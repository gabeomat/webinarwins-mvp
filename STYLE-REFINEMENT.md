# AI Style Refinement Feature

## Overview
WebinarWins uses a two-pass AI email generation system to create personalized follow-up emails that sound authentically like Gabriel, not like generic AI output.

## How It Works

### Pass 1: Content Generation
The first AI pass generates personalized email content based on:
- Attendee engagement metrics (focus %, attendance %, engagement score)
- Chat message activity (questions, comments, interactions)
- Webinar details (topic, offer, pricing, deadline)
- Engagement tier (Hot, Warm, Cool, Cold, No-Show)

**Output**: Factually accurate, personalized email with all the right details

### Pass 2: Style Refinement
The second AI pass takes the initial email and rewrites it in Gabriel's authentic voice using a comprehensive style guide:

**Style Elements:**
1. **Conversational & Relatable** - Casual, chatty tone like talking to a friend
2. **Vulnerable & Honest** - Openly shares struggles and emotions without filter
3. **Story-driven** - Uses personal examples and metaphors
4. **Bold & Edgy Language** - Strategic use of profanity and blunt phrasing
5. **Metaphorical & Playful** - Creative imagery and humor
6. **Self-Aware & Reflective** - Shows mindset shifts and growth
7. **Purposeful Structure** - Short paragraphs, natural breaks, scannable
8. **Invitational, not pushy** - Genuine calls to action

**Output**: Same factual content, transformed into Gabriel's raw, authentic voice

## Verification

### Check Supabase Logs
To verify style refinement is working:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ generate-emails â†’ Logs
2. Look for pairs of log entries:
   - `ðŸ“§ INITIAL EMAIL (before style refinement)` - shows the generic AI version
   - `âœ¨ REFINED EMAIL (Gabriel's voice)` - shows the styled version
3. Compare them side-by-side to see the transformation

### What to Look For
**Before (Initial)**: More formal, generic marketing language, longer paragraphs
**After (Refined)**: Casual tone, short punchy paragraphs, bold language, personal feel

## Technical Details

**Location**: `supabase/functions/generate-emails/index.ts`

**Function**: `refineEmailStyle()`
- Takes initial subject + body
- Applies style guide via OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Returns rewritten version with same facts, different tone

**Cost**: ~2x the OpenAI tokens (two API calls per email)
- Still very affordable with GPT-4o-mini (~$0.0003 per email)

**Performance**: Adds ~2-3 seconds per email generation
- Worth it for authentic, on-brand messaging

## Parser Robustness

The AI response parser has been enhanced to handle various formatting issues:

**Handles:**
- Markdown formatting (`**Subject:**` or `*text*`)
- Case-insensitive subject line detection
- Various probability marker formats
- Separator lines (`---`)
- Empty lines and whitespace variations

**Fallback Behavior:**
- If style refinement parsing fails â†’ uses initial email instead of failing completely
- Detailed error logs show exactly what was parsed and where it failed
- Graceful degradation ensures email generation succeeds even with parsing issues

## Status
âœ… **Deployed and Active** - Feature is live in production
âœ… **Tested and Verified** - Logs confirm style transformation working
âœ… **User Approved** - Refined emails match Gabriel's authentic voice
âœ… **Parser Robustness** - Handles markdown and various AI response formats
âœ… **Fallback Protection** - Never fails completely, uses initial email if refinement has issues

## Maintenance
The style guide is embedded directly in the Edge Function code. To update Gabriel's voice:
1. Edit the `styleGuide` string in `refineEmailStyle()` function
2. Redeploy the Edge Function to Supabase
3. Generate new emails to test the updated style
