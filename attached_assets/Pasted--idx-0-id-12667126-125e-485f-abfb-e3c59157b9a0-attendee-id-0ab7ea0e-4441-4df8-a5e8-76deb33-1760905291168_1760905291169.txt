Ten messages? You were practically a chat superstar. I loved seeing your questions and comments pop up — especially the one about vibe coding. It's like you were vibing with the whole idea of mixing technology and heart, which is exactly what we’re aiming for.\n\nI totally get the pushback on whether customers might feel they don’t need our coaching programs if they have access to GPT. It’s a valid concern. I mean, I’ve wrestled with that thought too. The truth is, it’s not about replacing the human touch; it’s about enhancing it. Think of AI as an assistant that amplifies your unique approach, not as a replacement for your expertise. Your coaching programs have something special that AI can’t replicate — YOU.\n\nI also noticed your question about limiting the sharing of GPT. That’s a smart thought! We always want to protect our intellectual property and ensure our customers feel secure in using these tools. It’s a big part of what our Futureproof community is all about — sharing knowledge while safeguarding our unique voices.\n\nSpeaking of the Futureproof community, I wanted to remind you about the special offer we’re running. If you join today, not only do you get access to the Evolution Lab for just $297, but there’s also the bonus AI CMO Bundle, which I think you’d find super valuable. It’s all about giving you the tools to scale without burning out, which I know is a big goal for you.\n\nIf you’re still on the fence, no stress. You’ve got until the end of the day to decide. I just wanted to make sure you had the info while you’re considering what’s next. And hey, if you missed any part of the webinar or want to revisit the convo, here’s the replay link: https://www.gabrielomat.com/replay.\n\nI appreciate your participation and curiosity.

It’s clear you’re passionate about helping ambitious corporate women navigate their career journeys, and that’s no small feat.\n\nI saw your questions about making mock interviews more interactive. How cool would it be to have a voice-based system that feels more like a real conversation? I mean, who wants to sit and type out answers when you could be having a genuine dialogue? You’ve definitely tapped into something that could elevate the coaching experience. I can only imagine the kind of impact you could make with that approach!\n\nAnd your thoughts on customizing the mock interview experience? Brilliant. Providing specific, tailored feedback can really set you apart. It’s all about creating that unique experience, right?

That’s such a meaningful project, and I can totally relate to the mix of excitement and uncertainty that comes with it. Imposter syndrome? We’ve all been there, right? Keep pushing through—it sounds like you’re onto something special.\n\nI also chuckled at your “AI syndrome” comment. It’s wild how technology can feel so both incredible and oddly flattering at the same time, isn’t it? The world is shifting fast, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by all the options out there. But I think your journey with it could really resonate with your audience.\n\nSpeaking of journeys, I wanted to remind you about the Futureproof community. It’s all about training AI on your intellectual property to scale your work without burning out. I know you’re considering coaching, and that’s exactly the kind of space where our community thrives—women supporting women, sharing insights, and growing together.\n\nIf you’re still on the fence, I totally understand.
